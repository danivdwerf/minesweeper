# Minesweeper

Dani van der Werf, GD3A

This was the first assignment of my third year on MediaCollege Amsterdam.
We had to recreate Minesweeper with as main goal to recreate the algorithm that shows all empty and numbered blocks when you click on an empty box.
We were free to chose which language an IDE we wanted to work in, so I chose to write c++ in Atom and do the GUI with the <a href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK+ library</a>.

MacOS installation:
<br />
Download the game <a href="http://freetimedev.com/resources/projects/Minesweeper/Minesweeper.dmg">here</a>,
open de dmg file and drag it in your desired folder. If you can't open the game normally, right click and press open.
