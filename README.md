# Minesweeper

Dani van der Werf, GD3A

This was the first assignment of my third year on MediaCollege Amsterdam.
We had to recreate Minesweeper with as main goal to get the algorithm that shows all empty and numbered blocks working.
We were free to choose which language an IDE we wanted to work in, so I chose to use c++.
I chose c++, because I find it to be rather fast and because c++ is my prefered language.
I worked in Atom and did the GUI with the <a href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK+ library</a>.
